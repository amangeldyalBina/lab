<p>Hayao Miyazaki (宮崎 駿, Miyazaki Hayao,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Japanese">[mijaꜜzaki hajaꜜo];</a>born 5 January 1941) is a Japanese animator, director, producer, screenwriter, author, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga_artist">manga artist.</a> A co-founder of <a href="n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a> he has attained international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and creator of animated feature films, and is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation.Born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunky%C5%8D">Bunkyo</a> ward of Tokyo, Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and animation from an early age, and he joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toei_Animation">Toei Animation</a>in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isao_Takahata">Isao Takahata</a> Notable films to which Miyazaki contributed at Toei include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggie_March">Doggie March</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver%27s_Travels_Beyond_the_Moon">Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon</a>. He provided key animation to other films at Toei, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonderful_World_of_Puss_%27n_Boots"> Puss in Boots</a> and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to A-Pro in 1971, where he co-directed  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupin_the_Third_Part_I">Lupin the Third Part I</a> alongside Takahata. After moving to Zuiyō Eizō (later known as Nippon Animation) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series Future Boy Conan (1978). He joined Tokyo Movie Shinsha in 1979 to direct his first feature film <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro">The Castle of Cagliostro</a> as well as the television series Sherlock Hound. In the same period, he also started writing and illustrating the manga Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1982–1994), and he also directed the 1984 film adaptation produced by Topcraft.

Miyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985. He directed numerous films with Ghibli, including Castle in the Sky (1986), My Neighbor Totoro (1988), Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), and Porco Rosso (1992). The films were met with critical and commercial success in Japan. Miyazaki's film Princess Mononoke was the first animated film ever to win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997;[a] its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan. His 2001 film Spirited Away became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history,[b] winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards, and is frequently ranked among the greatest films of the 2000s. Miyazaki's later films—Howl's Moving Castle (2004), Ponyo (2008), and The Wind Rises (2013)—also enjoyed critical and commercial success. Following the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, though he returned to work on the upcoming feature film How Do You Live? in 2016.

Miyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world. The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on animation and cinema in November 2014. Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration for numerous animators, directors, and writers.</p>

<hr>

<p>Hayao Miyazaki was born on 5 January 1941, in the town of Akebono-cho in Bunkyō, Tokyo, the second of four sons.[1][c] His father, Katsuji Miyazaki (born 1915),[2] was the director of Miyazaki Airplane, his brother's company,[4] which manufactured rudders for fighter planes during World War II.[5] The business allowed his family to remain affluent during Miyazaki's early life.[6][d] Miyazaki's father enjoyed purchasing paintings and demonstrating them to guests, but otherwise had little known artistic understanding.[3] He said that he was in the Imperial Japanese Army around 1940; after declaring to his commanding officer that he wished not to fight because of his wife and young child, he was discharged after a lecture about disloyalty.[8] According to Miyazaki, his father often told him about his exploits, claiming that he continued to attend nightclubs after turning 70.[9] Katsuji Miyazaki died on 18 March 1993.[10] After his death, Miyazaki felt that he had often looked at his father negatively and that he had never said anything "lofty or inspiring".[9] He regretted not having a serious discussion with his father, and felt that he had inherited his "anarchistic feelings and his lack of concern about embracing contradictions".[9]</p>

<p>Miyazaki has noted that some of his earliest memories are of "bombed-out cities".[12] In 1944, when he was three years old, Miyazaki's family evacuated to Utsunomiya.[5] After the bombing of Utsunomiya in July 1945, they evacuated to Kanuma.[6] The bombing left a lasting impression on Miyazaki, then aged four.[6] As a child, Miyazaki suffered from digestive problems, and was told that he would not live beyond 20, making him feel like an outcast.[13][11] From 1947 to 1955, Miyazaki's mother Yoshiko suffered from spinal tuberculosis; she spent the first few years in hospital, before being nursed from home.[5] Yoshiko was frugal,[3] and described as a strict, intellectual woman who regularly questioned "socially accepted norms".[4] She was closest with Miyazaki, and had a strong influence on him and his later work.[3][e] Yoshiko Miyazaki died in July 1983 at the age of 72.[17][18]

Miyazaki began school in 1947, at an elementary school in Utsunomiya, completing the first through third grades. After his family moved back to Suginami-ku, Miyazaki completed the fourth grade at Ōmiya Elementary School, and fifth grade at Eifuku Elementary School, which was newly established after splitting off from Ōmiya Elementary. After graduating from Eifuku as part of the first graduating class,[19] he attended Ōmiya Junior High School.[20] He aspired to become a manga artist,[21] but discovered he could not draw people; instead, he only drew planes, tanks, and battleships for several years.[21] Miyazaki was influenced by several manga artists, such as Tetsuji Fukushima, Soji Yamakawa and Osamu Tezuka. Miyazaki destroyed much of his early work, believing it was "bad form" to copy Tezuka's style as it was hindering his own development as an artist.[22][23][24] Around this time, Miyazaki would often see movies with his father, who was an avid moviegoer; memorable films for Miyazaki include Meshi (1951) and Tasogare Sakaba (1955).[25]

After graduating from Ōmiya Junior High, Miyazaki attended Toyotama High School.[25] During his third and final year, Miyazaki's interest in animation was sparked by Panda and the Magic Serpent (1958),[26] Japan's first feature-length animated film in color;[25] he had sneaked out to watch the film instead of studying for his entrance exams.[3] Miyazaki later recounted that he fell in love with the film's heroine, Bai-Niang, which moved him to tears and left a profound impression;[f] he wrote that he was "moved to the depths of [his] soul" and that the "pure, earnest world of the film" affirmed a side of him that "yearned desperately to affirm the world rather than negate it".[28] After graduating from Toyotama, Miyazaki attended Gakushuin University in the department of political economy, majoring in Japanese Industrial Theory.[25] He joined the "Children's Literature Research Club", the "closest thing back then to a comics club";[29] he was sometimes the sole member of the club.[25] In his free time, Miyazaki would visit his art teacher from middle school and sketch in his studio, where the two would drink and "talk about politics, life, all sorts of things".[30] Around this time, he also drew manga; he never completed any stories, but accumulated thousands of pages of the beginnings of stories. He also frequently approached manga publishers to rent their stories. In 1960, Miyazaki was a bystander during the Anpo protests, having developed an interest after seeing photographs in Asahi Graph; by that point, he was too late to participate in the demonstrations.[25] Miyazaki graduated from Gakushuin in 1963 with degrees in political science and economics.[29]</p>

<p>In 1963, Miyazaki was employed at Toei Animation;[31] this was the last year the company hired regularly.[34] After gaining employment, he began renting a four-and-a-half tatami apartment in Nerima, Tokyo; the rent was ¥6,000. His salary at Toei was ¥19,500.[34][g] Miyazaki worked as an in-between artist on the theatrical feature anime Doggie March and the television anime Wolf Boy Ken (both 1963). He also worked on Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon (1964).[35] He was a leader in a labor dispute soon after his arrival, and became chief secretary of Toei's labor union in 1964.[31] Miyazaki later worked as chief animator, concept artist, and scene designer on The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun (1968). Throughout the film's production, Miyazaki worked closely with his mentor, Yasuo Ōtsuka, whose approach to animation profoundly influenced Miyazaki's work.[36] Directed by Isao Takahata, with whom Miyazaki would continue to collaborate for the remainder of his career, the film was highly praised, and deemed a pivotal work in the evolution of animation.[37][38][39] Miyazaki moved to a residence in Ōizumigakuenchō in April 1969, after the birth of his second son.[40]

Under the pseudonym Akitsu Saburō (秋津 三朗), Miyazaki wrote and illustrated the manga People of the Desert, published in 26 installments between September 1969 and March 1970 in Boys and Girls Newspaper (少年少女新聞, Shōnen shōjo shinbun).[40] He was influenced by illustrated stories such as Fukushima's Evil Lord of the Desert (沙漠の魔王, Sabaku no maō).[41] Miyazaki also provided key animation for The Wonderful World of Puss 'n Boots (1969), directed by Kimio Yabuki.[42] He created a 12-chapter manga series as a promotional tie-in for the film; the series ran in the Sunday edition of Tokyo Shimbun from January to March 1969.[43][44] Miyazaki later proposed scenes in the screenplay for Flying Phantom Ship (1969), in which military tanks would cause mass hysteria in downtown Tokyo, and was hired to storyboard and animate the scenes.[45] In 1970, Miyazaki moved residence to Tokorozawa.[40] In 1971, he developed structure, characters and designs for Hiroshi Ikeda's adaptation of Animal Treasure Island; he created the 13-part manga adaptation, printed in Tokyo Shimbun from January to March 1971.[43][44][46] Miyazaki also provided key animation for Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.[47]

Miyazaki left Toei Animation in August 1971, and was hired at A-Pro,[48] where he directed, or co-directed with Takahata, 23 episodes of Lupin the Third Part I, often using the pseudonym Teruki Tsutomu (照樹 務).[47] The two also began pre-production on a series based on Astrid Lindgren's Pippi Longstocking books, designing extensive storyboards; the series was canceled after Miyazaki and Takahata were unable to meet with Lindgren, and permission was refused to complete the project.[48][49] In 1972 and 1973, Miyazaki wrote, designed and animated two Panda! Go, Panda! shorts, directed by Takahata.[50] After moving from A-Pro to Zuiyō Eizō in June 1973,[51] Miyazaki and Takahata worked on World Masterpiece Theater, which featured their animation series Heidi, Girl of the Alps, an adaptation of Johanna Spyri's Heidi. Zuiyō Eizō continued as Nippon Animation in July 1975.[51] Miyazaki also directed the television series Future Boy Conan (1978), an adaptation of Alexander Key's The Incredible Tide.[52]</p>

<p>Miyazaki left Nippon Animation in 1979, during the production of Anne of Green Gables;[53] he provided scene design and organization on the first fifteen episodes.[54] He moved to Telecom Animation Film, a subsidiary of TMS Entertainment, to direct his first feature anime film, The Castle of Cagliostro (1979), a Lupin III film.[55] In his role at Telecom, Miyazaki helped train the second wave of employees.[52] Miyazaki directed six episodes of Sherlock Hound in 1981, until issues with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's estate led to a suspension in production; Miyazaki was busy with other projects by the time the issues were resolved, and the remaining episodes were directed by Kyosuke Mikuriya. They were broadcast from November 1984 to May 1985.[56] Miyazaki also wrote the graphic novel The Journey of Shuna, inspired by the Tibetan folk tale "Prince who became a dog". The novel was published by Tokuma Shoten in June 1983,[57] and dramatised for radio broadcast in 1987.[58] Hayao Miyazaki's Daydream Data Notes was also irregularly published from November 1984 to October 1994 in Model Graphix;[59] selections of the stories received radio broadcast in 1995.[58]</p>

After the release of The Castle of Cagliostro, Miyazaki began working on his ideas for an animated film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights.[60][61] Around that time, Miyazaki was also approached for a series of magazine articles by the editorial staff of Animage. During subsequent conversations, he showed his sketchbooks and discussed basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with editors Toshio Suzuki and Osamu Kameyama, who saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Two projects were proposed: Warring States Demon Castle (戦国魔城, Sengoku ma-jō), to be set in the Sengoku period; and the adaptation of Corben's Rowlf. Both were rejected, as the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga, and the rights for the adaptation of Rowlf could not be secured.[62][63] An agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that it would never be made into a film.[64][65] The manga—titled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind—ran from February 1982 to March 1994. The story, as re-printed in the tankōbon volumes, spans seven volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages.[66] Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily in pencil, and it was printed monochrome in sepia toned ink.[67][68][65] Miyazaki resigned from Telecom Animation Film in November 1982.[69]</p>

<p>Following the success of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, Yasuyoshi Tokuma, the founder of Tokuma Shoten, encouraged Miyazaki to work on a film adaptation.[71] Miyazaki initially refused, but agreed on the condition that he could direct.[72] Miyazaki's imagination was sparked by the mercury poisoning of Minamata Bay and how nature responded and thrived in a poisoned environment, using it to create the film's polluted world. Miyazaki and Takahata chose the minor studio Topcraft to animate the film, as they believed its artistic talent could transpose the sophisticated atmosphere of the manga to the film.[71] Pre-production began on 31 May 1983; Miyazaki encountered difficulties in creating the screenplay, with only sixteen chapters of the manga to work with.[73] Takahata enlisted experimental and minimalist musician Joe Hisaishi to compose the film's score.[74] Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was released on 11 March 1984. It grossed ¥1.48 billion at the box office, and made an additional ¥742 million in distribution income.[75] It is often seen as Miyazaki's pivotal work, cementing his reputation as an animator.[76][h] It was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly that of main character Nausicaä.[78][79][i] Several critics have labeled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind as possessing anti-war and feminist themes; Miyazaki argues otherwise, stating that he only wishes to entertain.[81][j] The successful cooperation on the creation of the manga and the film laid the foundation for other collaborative projects.[82] In April 1984, Miyazaki opened his own office in Suginami Ward, naming it Nibariki.[70]</p>
